# File It

Color Computer Magazine, January 1984 issue, Pages 117-127

Just reliving some childhood memories. I remember typing this in from the
magazine while my dad called it out. He used it for some basic organization
and we set it up for my uncle who used it to manage contacts for his business.
Those were the cassette tape days as I didn't get a floppy drive for another
year or two.

I wasn't able to find this in any of the archives so I reproduced it from a PDF
of the magazine. Part OCR, part copy/paste, part typed.
